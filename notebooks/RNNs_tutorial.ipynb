    "In this demonstration, we will utilize techniques of _natural language processing_ (NLP) to train a classifier, which will analyze the text of radiology reports for chest radiographs to predict whether a report is **normal** or **abnormal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "We will utilize the [fast.ai v2 library](https://docs.fast.ai/), written primarily by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger (with help from many others). It is written in the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) and built on top of the [PyTorch deep learning library](https://www.pytorch.org/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The demonstration in this notebook relies heavily on examples from the `fast.ai` book, _Deep Learning for Coders with fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications without a PhD_ by Jeremy Howard and Sylvain Gugger, which was written entirely in Jupyter notebooks, which are [freely available for download on GitHub](https://github.com/fastai/fastbook). A print copy of the book can be purchased from Amazon.\n",
