    "\n",
    "In this demonstration, we will utilize techniques of _natural language processing_ (NLP) to train a classifier, which will analyze the text of radiology reports for chest radiographs to predict whether a report is **normal** or **abnormal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Code\n",
    "We will utilize four libraries from **HuggingFace**: [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/), [Accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/index), [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets), and [Evaluate](https://huggingface.co/docs/evaluate/en/package_reference/main_classes). These libraries are written primarily in the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) and can be used with both the [PyTorch](https://www.pytorch.org/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) deep learning libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "The demonstration in this notebook relies heavily on examples from the [HuggingFace Course](https://huggingface.co/course/chapter1).\n",

    "### Data\n",

    "The data is obtained from the National Library of Medicine's Open-i service. We utilize the radiology reports from the [Indiana University Chest X-ray Dataset](https://openi.nlm.nih.gov/faq#collection) for this demonstration.\n",
