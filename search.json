    "text": "Configuring Zsh and Oh My Zsh with Nano\nMost commonly, people configure Zsh in their .zshrc file. Installing OMZ will prepopulate yours with some useful stuff. Running ls in ~ won’t show you “dotfiles” (e.g. .zshrc) by default. For that, you should run ls -a (or la - an “alias” or shortcut for the preceding command). You should see something similar to what I’ve shown below, though everyone will probably have many other files and folders that get printed to the standard output (or “stdout”) when they run this command.\n$ ls -a\n-rw-------  1 walter walter  496 Oct  6 22:36 .bash_history\n-rw-r--r--  1 walter walter  220 Oct  6 22:50 .bashrc\ndrwxr-xr-x 11 walter walter 4.0K Oct  6 22:46 .oh-my-zsh\n-rw-------  1 walter walter  56K Nov 15 11:35 .zsh_history\n-rw-r--r--  1 walter walter 3.8K Nov 15 11:25 .zshrc\n# ... with other files mixed in\nNow, on to configuring Zsh in .zshrc. The first thing you should do is decide which text editor you want to use. Your options are a graphical text editor or one of the built-in text editors that run in the shell itself. For simplicity, we’ll go with nano - one of the built-in options. It’s far easier to use than vi or vim and simpler than opening a separate window every time you want to make a minor change to your config. Entering nano ~/.zshrc will launch nano with your config file in the editor. At the bottom of the window, you should see the commands available to you (FYI: ^G is shorthand for {CTRL + G}). After you make changes, you will need to press ^O (letter O, not number) to “write out” (i.e. save) your changes before you ^X (exit). Also, you’ll be navigating with the keyboard as your mouse won’t work.\nEverything you see in your .zshrc has been added by OMZ. The first thing we’ll do is change the theme. Navigate to the line that says ZSH_THEME=\"robbyrussell\". We’re going to change the theme to “agnoster”, so delete “robbyrussell” and replace it with “agnoster” such that the line now looks like this ZSH_THEME=\"agnoster\". Then ^O and ^X. Now you’ve saved your changes, exited nano and are back in Zsh…but everything looks the same.\nTo see the effects of your changes to the config, you’ll have to reload your shell. The command for this is source ~/.zshrc. Over time, you may find yourself tweaking your shell config regularly, adding or changing different aliases, etc. Thus, I recommend you go ahead and add the following lines to your .zshrc under # Aliases. You may wish to delete the existing ones.\nalias zshconfig=\"nano ~/.zshrc\"\nalias reload=\"source ~/.zshrc\"\nYou will have to reload your shell profile with the full command before you can use your new aliases. But after you do that, you’ll be able to edit your config in nano simply by entering zshconfig, then reload when you’re done.\nIf you are using the VS Code editor, you can replace the nano command with the code command."

    "text": "Purpose of the shell/CLI\nThe shell is a phenomenal tool for working with and managing files that are predominantly composed of text. These include *.txt, *.csv, and *.html files, in addition to Dotfiles and files without extensions, among many other file types. The shell is also really useful for managing processes and working on remote systems, such as servers.\n\n\n\nBash running in the Terminal app on MacOS\n\n\n\nDue to the ability to work directly and efficiently with text files, the shell is a critical tool for developers and data scientists. Basically, anyone regularly writing and running code could benefit from becoming more familiar with the shell. Given its ubiquity in the tech world, there are plenty of great tutorials out there that can help introduce you to the glories of the Command Line.\n\n\n\nZsh running in the iTerm app on MacOS\n\n\n\nThe tutorial I link to below is one of the more succinct introductions that should help you get started. However, it’s very easy to get stuck in the proverbial “Tutorial Hell”. So we won’t beat around the bush here.\nOne advantage of this tutorial is that you can run the shell code via the terminal emulator provided on the website. However, I recommend you try to get these scripts running in your own terminal.\nNote #1: As defined above, shell scripts are text files of shell code that can be run in the terminal with any output printed to the stdout of the shell. One way to create and run your own script is to run the following code. The structure or syntax of these commands is command --options arg1 arg2. You may not always use options or arguments (args) and some commands like chmod have special syntax for options.\nNote #2: in the below code, # precedes a “comment”, which is only intended to explain the code and is not executable code.\ntouch script.sh     # creates a new file in the current working directory\nls                  # list the files in the cwd, you should now see 'script.sh' among these\nchmod +x script.sh  # gives the current user execute permissions for the file\nnano script.sh      # open the file with the nano text editor (can use 'code' command for VS Code)\n\n# now you can copy and paste or transcribe the code from the tutorial into the file and save it\nbash script.sh      # runs the script\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nLearn Shell Interactive Tutorial: Proceed to the linked page and complete each exercise under “Learn the Basics”.\n\n\nAfter you complete this tutorial, check back for the next Command Line post, where we’ll download some data for an intro to Machine Learning in Radiology and use shell functions & scripts to rename and move files into a more convenient directory structure before we move on to implement our first algorithm."

While we don’t need to understand everything about how these tools work, I think it helps to understand a little about how “the sausage is made” in order to use these tools effectively.

    "title": "Basic Setup Guide",
    "section": "",
    "text": "This guide will step you through the process of setting up your development environment for using the command line to run programs in Python. The ideal operating system (OS) to use is a Unix-based system such as MacOS or a Linux distribution (e.g. Ubuntu). For simplicity, I’ll assume you’re using MacOS, as Linux users probably won’t need many of these tutorials.\nFor users on Windows 10 or 11, your best bet is to install the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nI recommend selecting the Ubuntu distribution directly from the Windows Store:  WSL Ubuntu Installation Tutorial.\n\n\nWSL should afford a similar experience to MacOS, though you may end up spending a little more time with Google and Stack Overflow to get certain elements of the your development environment up and running.\n\nInstalling Developer Tools\n\nAgain, from here on out, we’re assuming that you’re using MacOS… I’ll try to add support for WSL as this site evolves.\nThe first step is to open up a terminal window. The easiest way to do this is to launch the Spotlight app via the keyboard shortcut {CMD-SPACE}, then type “terminal”, followed by {ENTER}.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t already, this is the perfect time to head over to the Intro to CLI post for an introduction to the Command Line Interface (CLI or “shell”).\n\n\nNow, the next thing we need to do is install the Command Line Tools for Xcode. This will ensure that you have the full range of command line tools available to you - a necessary step before Advanced Setup. Enter the following command into your terminal window.\nxcode-select --install\n\nText Editors\n\nEvery programmer has his or her preferred text editor. I use VS Code. I used to use Sublime Text. I dabble in vim for when I want to quickly edit a config file or a shell script without leaving my Terminal. I don’t recommend vim to beginners. VS Code is free and works great out of the box and is very configurable/extensible. Do a little research for yourself and figure out which text editor might be best for you. Just pick a nice one with some simple features like syntax highlighting and it will make programming/coding a lot more fun…and efficient.\nIf you plan to do the Advanced Setup, this would be a good time to stop and head over there before continuing with these steps.\nIf not, feel free to proceed.\n\nOption 1: Installing Python with Anaconda\n\nThough Python comes preinstalled with recent versions of MacOS, I highly recommend using a package and environment manager such as Anaconda (or Miniconda) for managing Python packages and virutal environments (more on these later). You could follow this link to download and install Anaconda with all of it’s bells and whistles. However, since we’re learning the command line, I recommend you go with Miniconda, a lighter-weight version without the Spyder independent development environment (IDE).\nThe only potential downside of installing a version of conda is that Pytorch has recently announced that they are deprecating support for conda packages. Meaning that if you’ve already been using Pytorch, there may be a point in the near future that you need a different option. If you think this might be the case for you, then I suggest giving uv a try (see Option 2 below).\nIf you go with Miniconda, enter the following commands into your terminal window from your home directory. These come from the Miniconda Quick Command Line Install guide and are current as of 20 December 2024. I’ve added them here so I can explain what’s happening. The first command uses mkdir to create a subdirectory of your home folder called miniconda. The -p flag ensures that no error occurs if the directory already exists and will create any “parent” directories, if necessary. The second command uses curl to download the installation file. The -o option renames the file to the shorter miniconda.sh and downloads that file to the miniconda directory. The third command uses the bash shell to run the miniconda.sh shell script, which will install miniconda. The final command cleans up the install file with the rm command (“remove”), since it is no longer needed.\nmkdir -p ~/miniconda3\ncurl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh -o ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh\nbash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3\nrm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh\nFollow any prompts that arise during the install process. Once this is complete, the next thing you’ll want to do is restart your terminal. Then test whether the install worked by entering a conda command (e.g. conda list). If this produces an error, then there are a couple of possibilities as to why this may not have worked, most of which should be fixed after the next step.\nThe next step is to check your shell config file, either ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc. Open this file in nano or your favorite graphical text editor. The Miniconda install process should have appended the following line to your “rc” file: export PATH=“~/miniconda3/bin:$PATH”. This command prepends the path to the Miniconda functions to your system path environment variable. If this is not the case, then you should add this line manually, save your changes and reload your shell (open a new terminal window or source your rc file).\n\nOption 2: Installing Python with uv\n\nAnother option for installing a managed version of Python is uv. The recommended way to install this package is via the following command from the uv Installation guide, and is current as of 20 December 2024.\nThis command uses curl to download the installation shell script, then “pipes” the file to the sh shell, which runs the script.\ncurl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\nFollow any instructions during the installation process. Once it is complete, close and reopen your terminal window to “restart” your shell and then run the following command to install the latest stable version of Python.\nuv python install\nIf you need to install a specific version of Python for compatibility with existing code or a tutorial you’re following, then use the following command and change the version number to match your needs.\nuv python install 3.12\n\nCongrats!\n\nYou’ve completed Basic Setup. If you haven’t already, I recommend proceeding to the Advanced Setup guide… or go straight to learning more about the command line, shell scripting, and Python!"
