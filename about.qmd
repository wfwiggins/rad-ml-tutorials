I'm a neuroradiologist who likes to code. By day, I split my time between (1) taking care of patients by interpreting diagnostic imaging of the brain, head, neck, and spine, as well as doing image-guided, minimally invasive procedures; and (2) working hard to deploy and monitor AI tools for radiology.

Education around AI and machine learning is vital for radiologists. While we don't need to understand everything about how these tools work, I think it helps to understand a little about how "the sausage is made" in order to use these tools effectively. Just like diagnostic imaging modalities, you should have a basic understanding of AI's uses and limitations, as well as some common ways it can fail.

This blog is dedicated to interactive tutorials covering various topics in AI & ML for medical imaging and natural language processing (NLP) or text analysis.

I hope you enjoy!

Cheers,
Walter
